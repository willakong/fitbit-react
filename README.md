# React
A Fitbit wearable app for testing reaction time. This app is available in the [Fitbit gallery](https://gallery.fitbit.com/details/cb7d1825-1751-408f-adb0-e60217893e84).

## Using it

As seen from the title screen, reaction time is determined by recording the delay between the screen turning green and a tap on the wearable face.

The results screen will display the reaction time. Tapping the screen again will allow another try at getting a better time.
